# AVR_ASM_Morse_Code
Morse code program written in AVR Assembly for the Ardunio Uno R3
<br/>
Created for Computer Organization and architecture class
<br/>
Controls the LED on the Arduino Uno R3
<br/>
Cannot directly write assembly in the Arduino IDE
<br/>
ldino is used to circumvent this
<br/>
asm.sh is a bash script I wrote to make the assembling process quicker
<br/>
Also need the AVR Toolchain installed to run this program on the Uno R3
