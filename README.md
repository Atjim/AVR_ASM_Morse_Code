# AVR_ASM_Morse_Code
Morse code program written in AVR Assembly for the Ardunio Uno R3
<br/>
Created for Computer Organization and architecture class
Controls the LED on the Arduino Uno R3
Cannot directly write assembly in the Arduino IDE
ldino is used to circumvent this
asm.sh is a bash script I wrote to make the assembling process quicker
Also need the AVR Toolchain installed to run this program on the Uno R3
